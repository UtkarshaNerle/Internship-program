The Exskilence internship program is designed to give you a solid and structured practical experience, focusing on hands-on work.

During the internship, you will have access to over 7+ hours of HTML study materials, 4+ hours of CSS content, and 7+ hours of JavaScript lessons. Each of these subjects comes with 30+ practical tasks to help you learn by doing it yourself. You will also work on 200+ SQL coding tasks, 200+ Python coding tasks, 10+ website creation tasks, besides a specially designed Python Full-Stack project.

To help you through this process, there will be over 100 hours of live discussion sessions, and one-on-one interaction sessions (if deemed necessary by our trainers). Your progress will be monitored closely through this entire process. Our goal is to help you gain the practical skills and knowledge that you need to succeed in a practical work environment. The outcomes will depend on your attitude and seriousness throughout this learning process.
